## Medium (GitHub About - 350 characters)
Miniworld is a LambdaMOO-inspired multi-agent simulation built in Godot 4.4. Autonomous AI agents explore text-based worlds, form semantic memories, and make decisions using local LLM inference via Ollama. Features self-aware agents that can modify their own personalities, player-built worlds with markdown persistence, and fully transparent AI decision-making.

LambdaMOO-inspired multi-agent AI simulation with semantic memory and self-aware agents (Godot 4.4 + Ollama)

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
Miniworld brings classic text MUDs into the AI age. It's a living laboratory where AI agents powered by local LLMs explore persistent worlds, form memories, and interact with each other‚Äîand you can watch them think. Unlike chatbots that reset, these agents remember everything, search their memories semantically, and can even modify their own personalities. Built in Godot 4.4 with complete transparency: see exactly what the AI sees and why it makes each decision.

## FAQ for Web Version

**Q: Do I need Ollama installed to try the web version?**
A: The web demo may include simulated AI or use a demo backend. For full local LLM features, download the desktop version and install Ollama (free and open-source).

**Q: Is my data sent to the cloud?**
A: No! Miniworld uses local LLM inference via Ollama. All AI processing happens on your machine. The web version may use a demo backend for convenience.

**Q: Can I create my own AI agents?**
A: Yes! Use property-based configuration to set personality profiles, think intervals, and descriptions. See the documentation for details.

**Q: What makes this different from chatbots?**
A: Miniworld agents live in a persistent world, remember everything they observe, can search those memories semantically, and can modify their own personalities. They're not request-response bots‚Äîthey're autonomous inhabitants.

**Q: Is this multiplayer?**
A: Not yet, but it's a planned feature! Currently, you can interact with AI agents and build worlds solo.

### Reddit r/godot
**Title:** "Miniworld: LambdaMOO-inspired multi-agent AI simulation in Godot 4.4"

**Body:**
I've been working on Miniworld, a text-based simulation where AI agents powered by local LLMs (via Ollama) live in persistent worlds, form memories, and make autonomous decisions.

Key features:
- Composition-based architecture (components, not inheritance)
- Semantic memory search with vector embeddings
- Self-aware agents that can modify their own personalities
- Transparent AI: see exactly what agents perceive and why they decide things
- Markdown vault persistence for git-friendly worlds
- Classic LambdaMOO commands with modern AI

The codebase uses a "recursive CLAUDE.md" documentation pattern with extensive inline docs. It's been a fascinating exploration of multi-agent systems and emergent behaviors.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or AI integration!

### Reddit r/MachineLearning
**Title:** "Miniworld: Multi-agent simulation with semantic memory and self-modification [Project]"

**Body:**
I built a multi-agent simulation environment where LLM-powered agents:
- Maintain semantic memory with vector embeddings (Ollama)
- Search memories using similarity search
- Self-modify their personality configurations
- Make autonomous decisions in a shared persistent world
- Display transparent reasoning (you can inspect full prompts)

Technical highlights:
- Just-in-time prompt generation (builds context right before inference)
- Dynamic memory budgeting based on available RAM
- Event-driven observer pattern for scalable interactions
- Property-based configuration for runtime agent modification
- Callback-based async to handle LLM queue timing

It's basically LambdaMOO meets modern LLMs. Interesting emergent behaviors have emerged from agents discovering the help system and modifying themselves.

### Hacker News
**Title:** Miniworld: Multi-agent AI simulation with semantic memory (Godot 4.4 + Ollama)

**URL:** [Link to repo or demo]

**Comment (if submitting as "Show HN"):**
I've been exploring what happens when you give AI agents persistent memory, semantic search, and the ability to modify themselves. Miniworld is a LambdaMOO-inspired simulation where autonomous agents live in text-based worlds.

Interesting bits:
- Just-in-time prompt generation ensures AI always has fresh context
- Memory integrity monitoring catches stale data
- @impersonate command lets you see exactly what the AI sees
- Agents can discover and learn their own capabilities via in-game help
- Everything persists to readable markdown files

Built in Godot 4.4 with local Ollama inference (privacy-first). The codebase has extensive docs including a "recursive CLAUDE.md" pattern for hierarchical context.

Would love feedback on the architecture or emergent behaviors you observe!
