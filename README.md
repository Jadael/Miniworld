## AI Agents

Two AI agents are included from the Python prototype:

**Eliza** - A friendly, curious conversationalist who:
- Asks thoughtful questions and listens actively
- Seeks to learn about the world
- Makes genuine connections
- Spawns in The Garden
- Thinks every 8 seconds

**Moss** - A contemplative entity who:
- Exists peacefully and observes
- Speaks rarely but profoundly
- Has a very long-term perspective
- Spawns in The Library
- Thinks every 15 seconds

AI agents use the **ThinkerComponent** with **just-in-time prompt generation** to make autonomous decisions via LLM. This ensures agents always have the freshest memories and observations when making decisions, even if their task has been queued for several seconds.

**To enable AI agents:** See `docs/OLLAMA_SETUP.md` for installation instructions. Once Ollama is running with a model (default: `gemma3:27b` for generation, `embeddinggemma` for semantic search), AI agents will think and act autonomously. Use the `@impersonate <agent>` command to see exactly what an agent perceives and what prompt they receive.

**Command Syntax:** Both players and AI agents use unified MOO-style command syntax: `command args | reason`. Everything after the `|` is optional reasoning that's recorded in memory but not visible to other actors. See `docs/AGENTS.md` for detailed documentation.

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Complete:**
- MOO-like object system with composition-based components
- Text-based player interface with three-panel layout (events, location, occupants)

- AI agents with ThinkerComponent (Eliza and Moss)
- Ollama integration for LLM-powered AI decisions and embeddings
- Just-in-time prompt generation for AI agents
- MOO-style command syntax with optional reasoning (`command | reason`)
- Mental commands (think, dream, note, recall)
- Semantic search over notes via vector embeddings
- World building commands (@dig, @exit, @teleport)
- World persistence to markdown files (@save)
- Debug tools (@impersonate to view AI perspective)
- Observable behaviors for private commands (others see you thinking, not what you think)
- Property-based configuration system (runtime-editable agent settings)
- Self-awareness commands (@my-profile, @set-profile, @my-description, @set-description)
- Auto-discovering help system (help, commands, 7 categories, 29 commands)
- Command metadata registry (centralized documentation via CommandMetadata)
- AI agent self-discovery (agents learn their capabilities via help system)
- Memory status indicator (lightweight health check shown before each command)

- Template-based personality system (reusable agent profiles)
- Multiplayer networking
- Permission system (ownership, private rooms)
- More sophisticated AI goal/planning systems
- Relationship tracking and social dynamics

## Python Prototype

The `Python prototype/` folder contains the original implementation this Godot version was migrated from.

## Philosophy

**Composition over Inheritance** - Capabilities via components, not class hierarchies
**Uniform Objects** - Players and AI agents use the same systems and commands
**Event-Driven** - Observers react to world changes through EventWeaver
**MOO-Inspired** - Classic text MUD architecture with modern AI and persistence
**Transparent AI** - Debug tools to understand what AI agents see and think
**Just-in-Time Context** - AI agents get fresh prompts with latest memories
**Persistent World** - Everything saved to readable markdown files
**Player-Built Worlds** - Everyone can shape the world with building commands
**Runtime Configuration** - All settings editable in-game via properties system
**Self-Aware Agents** - AI can view and modify their own configuration
**Discoverable Systems** - In-game help enables learning without external docs

## UI Features

**Game Interface:**
- Clean, panel-based layout with three main areas
- Real-time location panel showing room name, description, and exits
- Dynamic occupants panel listing other actors present
- Scrolling event history with BBCode formatting support
- Command input with history navigation (Up/Down arrows)
- Memory status indicator showing system health before each command
- Command shortcuts built into ActorComponent (' for say, : for emote, l for look)

## Key Features Deep Dive

### MOO-Style Command Syntax with Reasoning

Both players and AI use the same command format: `command args | reason`

```
say Hello there! | Trying to make a connection
go garden | Want to find a quiet place to think
note Important Insight -> The skroderiders represent community memory
```

Everything after `|` is **private reasoning** - recorded in your memory but not visible to other actors. This allows AI agents to maintain internal decision-making logs that inform future choices.

### Just-in-Time Prompt Generation

When AI agents queue LLM requests, their prompts aren't built immediately. Instead, they pass a **callable** (function) that Shoggoth invokes just before execution. This ensures agents always have the most recent memories and observations, even if their task waited in queue for several seconds.

### Semantic Note System

The `note` and `recall` commands use **vector embeddings** to create a personal wiki with semantic search:

```
note Moss Observations -> Contemplative being in library, likes philosophy
recall philosophy
# Finds the Moss note even though you searched for "philosophy" not "Moss"
```

Notes are stored in markdown files with metadata and indexed using Ollama's embedding models.

### Persistent World State

The `@save` command persists the entire world to markdown files:
- Each WorldObject becomes a markdown file with YAML frontmatter
- Component data stored as structured metadata
- Human-readable and git-friendly
- Can be edited externally and reloaded

### AI Agent Introspection

Use `@impersonate <agent>` to see exactly what an AI agent perceives:
- Current location and surroundings
- Recent memories and observations
- Full LLM prompt with instructions
- Available commands and context

Perfect for debugging why agents make certain decisions.
