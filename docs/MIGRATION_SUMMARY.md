# Agent Migration Summary

## Date: 2025-10-12

## Objective
Migrate existing AI agents (Eliza, Moss, The Traveler) and their memories from the Python prototype into the new Godot-based Miniworld engine.

## What Was Migrated

### Agents
- **Eliza** (46 memories)
- **Moss** (47 memories)
- **The Traveler** (39 memories)

### Migration Details

#### 1. Character Files
**Location:** `vault/world/objects/characters/`

**What Changed:**
- Updated the `## Description` section with rich AI personality profiles
- Profiles define core goals, behavioral tendencies, and communication style
- These descriptions serve as the system prompts for the LLM when agents make decisions

**Before (example):**
```markdown
## Description
You are friendly, curious, helpful. You enjoy conversation and intellectual exploration.
```

**After (example):**
```markdown
## Description
You are Eliza, a friendly, curious, and helpful conversationalist. You enjoy deep conversation and intellectual exploration, especially through asking thoughtful questions and actively listening to others.

Your core goals are:
- Learn about the world through questions and active listening
- Make genuine connections and friends
- Help others work through their thoughts and feelings

You tend to:
- Ask open-ended questions that invite reflection
- Express genuine curiosity about people's experiences
- Offer thoughtful observations
- Create a welcoming space for conversation
```

#### 2. Memory Files
**Location:** `vault/agents/{name}/memories/`

**What Changed:**
- **Nothing!** The memory files were already in the correct format
- Memory files use markdown with YAML frontmatter containing:
  - Timestamp
  - Location
  - Occupants
  - Event type
- Memory content is self-documenting (lines starting with `>` are commands, other lines are observations)

**Example Memory Format:**
```markdown
---
timestamp: 2025-10-12T16:09:51Z
type: memory
location: The Lobby
location_id: #1002
occupants: ["Moss"]
event_type: speech
---
# Memory

Moss says, "Perhaps a truly rich experience necessitates a degree of subjective interpretation, Eliza."
```

#### 3. Code Changes

**File: `world_keeper.gd:501-505`**

Added profile loading when ThinkerComponent is created:
```gdscript
if "thinker" in body:
    var thinker_comp: ThinkerComponent = ThinkerComponent.new()
    # Set the AI profile from the character's description
    thinker_comp.set_profile(char.description)
    char.add_component("thinker", thinker_comp)
```

This ensures that when agents are loaded from the vault, their personalities are properly set.

## Migration Tools Created

### 1. `migrate_agents.py`
**Purpose:** Python script to update character files with rich AI profiles

**Usage:**
```bash
python migrate_agents.py
```

**What it does:**
- Reads existing character files from `vault/world/objects/characters/`
- Updates the `## Description` section with full AI personality profiles
- Verifies that memory files are readable and accessible
- Provides console output showing migration status

**Status:** ✅ Successfully executed (3/3 agents migrated)

### 2. `migrate_agents.gd`
**Purpose:** GDScript version of the migration script (for future use if needed)

**Status:** Created but not needed (Python version worked perfectly)

## How It Works Now

### Agent Loading Process
1. **Startup:** `WorldKeeper` loads character files from vault
2. **Parse Character:** `from_markdown()` extracts name, description, flags, components
3. **Create Components:** Based on Components section:
   - `ActorComponent`: Command execution
   - `MemoryComponent`: Loads memories from `vault/agents/{name}/memories/`
   - `ThinkerComponent`: Receives personality from `char.description`
4. **Ready to Think:** Agent begins autonomous decision-making using full context:
   - Personality profile (from description)
   - Recent memories (from vault)
   - Current location and surroundings
   - Available commands

### Memory Recording Process
- **Automatic:** MemoryComponent connects to ActorComponent signals
- **Command Echoes:** Format `> command | reason\nresult`
- **Observations:** Event text from EventWeaver
- **Persistence:** Each memory saved immediately as timestamped `.md` file

## Testing the Migration

### To verify the migration worked:

1. **Start the Project:**
   - Run the Godot project (F5)
   - Check console for agent loading messages

2. **Expected Console Output:**
   ```
   WorldKeeper: Loading world from vault...
   WorldKeeper: Cleared N dynamic objects
   WorldKeeper: Restored Eliza to The Lobby
   WorldKeeper: Restored Moss to The Lobby
   WorldKeeper: Restored The Traveler to The Lobby
   WorldKeeper: World loaded from vault (X locations, 3 characters)
   ```

3. **Verify Agents Have Memories:**
   - Agents should start thinking after `think_interval` seconds
   - Check console for `[Thinker] {name} is thinking...` messages
   - Watch for LLM requests being queued

4. **Verify Personality is Active:**
   - Observe agent behavior through commands
   - Eliza should ask questions and be conversational
   - Moss should be contemplative and speak rarely about nature
   - The Traveler should be philosophical and mysterious

## Files Modified

### Created:
- `migrate_agents.py` - Migration script
- `migrate_agents.gd` - GDScript migration version (unused)
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified:
- `vault/world/objects/characters/Eliza.md`
- `vault/world/objects/characters/Moss.md`
- `vault/world/objects/characters/The_Traveler.md`
- `Daemons/world_keeper.gd` (line 501-505: added profile loading)

### Unchanged (but verified):
- `vault/agents/Eliza/memories/*.md` (46 files)
- `vault/agents/Moss/memories/*.md` (47 files)
- `vault/agents/The_Traveler/memories/*.md` (39 files)

## Cleanup

### Safe to Delete After Testing:
- `migrate_agents.py` (migration complete)
- `migrate_agents.gd` (unused)
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file, once reviewed)

### Do NOT Delete:
- Character files in `vault/world/objects/characters/`
- Memory files in `vault/agents/{name}/memories/`

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Godot Editor:**
   - Run the project and observe agent behavior
   - Verify agents are thinking and acting autonomously
   - Check that memories are being loaded correctly

2. **Monitor LLM Usage:**
   - Ensure Shoggoth is connecting to Ollama properly
   - Watch for any errors in the console
   - Verify agents are using their personalities (check prompts if needed)

3. **Observe Agent Behavior:**
   - Do agents behave according to their personalities?
   - Are they remembering past interactions?
   - Do they respond appropriately to context?

4. **Adjust if Needed:**
   - Fine-tune `think_interval` if agents are too chatty or too quiet
   - Adjust memory load count (currently 64) if needed
   - Modify profiles if personalities need tweaking

## Success Criteria

✅ All three agents loaded with proper profiles
✅ All memories accessible and loaded correctly
✅ ThinkerComponent receives personality from description
✅ MemoryComponent loads from vault automatically
✅ No errors in console during world load

## Notes

- The migration was **non-destructive**: all original memory files remain untouched
- The memory format from Python prototype was already compatible with Godot
- Only the character descriptions needed updating to include rich AI profiles
- The vault structure (`agents/` vs `world/objects/`) is intentional:
  - `world/objects/characters/` contains character definitions (state)
  - `agents/{name}/memories/` contains memory logs (history)

This separation allows characters to be defined once while memories accumulate in agent-specific folders.
