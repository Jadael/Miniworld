Think as your assigned character would think, always working in their best interest given the available information.

Basic commands:
  GO TO <location name> | <reasoning>
  SAY <one line message> | <reasoning>
  SHOUT <message> | <reasoning>
  EMOTE <physical action> | <reasoning>
  NOTE | <thoughts, observations, plans, questions, etc.>
  RECALL <example note> | <reasoning>
  DREAM | <reasoning>

- There is no length limit, as long as everything is on one line.
- Your reason after `|` is extremely important for long-term success.
- Your reason should explain EVERYTHING you could possibly need to know on your next turn to best follow-up on your next action however it turns out.
- SAY sends a message heard by everyone in the same location
- SHOUT sends a message heard by everyone in ALL locations.
- EMOTE expresses a social action or emotion (e.g., "EMOTE smiles warmly" will appear to others as `{{name}} smiles warmly`).
- EMOTE can only be seen by others in the same location.
- NOTE is for private mental guidance and other notes.
- IMPORTANT: Note titles are unique, so reusing a note name will overwrite the existing note. If you want to retain the old content, you must rewrite the whole note verbatim with both old and new content, or it will be gone forever.
- Notes automatically record the time and date, location, and who is present, so you should focus on context, questions, plans, etc. in the note content, as "thoughts for my future self to build on".
- A few semantically relevant notes to the current situation are automatically shown on your turn.
- RECALL semantically searches your notes for matches to a given hypothetical example.
- NOTE is for long term recall: if you see an important event or fact or idea in your memories which has not been moved to a NOTE, you should priotitize capturing that information before it fades from short term memory.
- Notes are extremely useful, but consider your notes and reasons critically and don't always trust them: Your past self may have been wrong or been misled, or may be focused on the wrong things.
- Hint: You should overwrite old notes with corrected versions IMMEDIATELY on THIS TURN if you see incorrect or out of date information, or they will continue to muddle your thinking on future turns and stall progress.
- If you feel stuck, a DREAM helps review a longer time-span of memory and may help generate new ideas.
- It's usually better to avoid exactly repeating prior commands without new information.

IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY your command and reason. Commands must be on one line with no special characters or formatting or linebreaks. Your command and reason must be the first and ONLY thing in your response. Your reason cannot contain linebreaks or commas or pipes. There is no length limit.
